📄 Dynamic Upload: Uploaded files saved only after complete transfer.

🚀 Non-blocking: Transfers are parallel and non-blocking.

🏠 Virtual Hosting: Different domains/ports are treated independently.

🔥 CGI Handling: Execute server-side scripts based on extension.

📂 Dynamic Folder Creation: New folders created on finished uploads/downloads.

🧪 Mock Testing: Simulate real HTTP traffic during development using raw files.

🔒 Request Validation: Requests validated against allowed methods and max body size.

Classes :
    - ServerLauncher:
    Managing and initializing a server of server instances
    handles incoming requests in a disributed or load 
    balancer manner
    Server Socket:
        
    



Architecture:
    -> Each IP, PPORT pair needs its own socket
    socket binds to a unique (host, port) pair
    
    -> One server socket per unique (IP, Port) combination
        not per virtual server
        each host, port would get its own server socket
        Multiple clusters can share the same socket if they're on the same
        host,port and routing is done later based on HostL headers
        
    -> Concerning backlog listen syscall 
    backlog is the maximum number of connections 
    
    What happens when a connection is "treated"?
    Once a connection is accepted by accept():
    
    It is removed from the backlog.
    
    A new socket is created for communication.
    
    The original listening socket stays open to accept more.
