1. Global Configuration:
    max_body_size: Mandatory
    Sets the maximum allowed size for client request bodies.
    The default is 1MB (1048576 bytes).

default_error_pages: Optional
    Specifies custom error pages for different HTTP error codes (e.g., 400, 404, 500).
    You can choose to configure this or rely on the default error handling by the server.

2. Server Definitions:
    host: Mandatory
    Specifies the IP address or hostname where the server listens. In your case, "0.0.0.0" means it listens on all available network interfaces.

    port: Mandatory
    Specifies the ports on which the server listens. This is required to define where the server will be accessible.

    hostnames: Optional
    Defines specific hostnames that the server will respond to. If not provided, the server will respond to all incoming requests on the specified host and port.

3. Route Configurations:
    path: Mandatory
    Specifies the route or URL path that this configuration applies to. Every route must have a path to define where it will handle requests.
    
    root: Mandatory
    Defines the root directory for serving files or where the script resides. It's required for static content.

    methods: Mandatory
    Specifies the HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, HEAD) that are allowed for this route. At least one method should be specified.

    index: Optional
    Defines the default file to serve when the user accesses a directory (e.g., index.html). This is optional; you can omit it if not required.

    autoindex: Optional
    If set to true, this enables automatic directory listing if no index file is found. It's optional.

    redirect: Optional
    Specifies a URL to redirect requests to another location. You should include this only when you need to redirect traffic (e.g., from old-site to new-site).

4. CGI Configuration:
    extensions: Optional
    Defines the file extensions that should be treated as CGI scripts (e.g., .php, .py). This is only required when you want to execute CGI scripts for specific extensions.

    interpreter: Optional
    Specifies the CGI interpreter (e.g., /usr/bin/php-cgi) for processing the script. This is required if you're handling CGI scripts.

5. File Uploads:
    upload_dir: Optional
    Specifies the directory where uploaded files should be stored. This is required only if you want to enable file uploads for specific routes (e.g., /uploads).
