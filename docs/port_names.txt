When using commands like lsof, netstat, or ss, 
you might notice that some ports display as names 
(e.g., http, webmin) instead of numbers (e.g., 80, 10000). 
Here’s why—and how to control it.

Your system translates well-known port numbers into service names using:
/etc/services – A file that maps ports to names 
(e.g., 80 = http, 10000 = webmin).

Why Some Ports Show Numbers

Common ports (e.g., 80, 443, 22) usually show names.

Uncommon ports (e.g., 10001, 12345) 
show numbers because they aren’t in /etc/services.

//! use -P (for lsof) or -n (for netstat/ss) to disable name resolution
