ðŸ“¨ request_mock.txt (the incoming request)
    It should contain a full raw HTTP request â€” as if a real client had sent it over the socket.

    Meaning: request line, headers, optional body in correct HTTP format.

    Example content:

        GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
        Host: localhost:8080
        User-Agent: PostmanRuntime/7.32.3
        Accept: */*

        <blank line here>
        (optional body if it's a POST)


ðŸ“¦ response_mock.txt (the outgoing response)

    It should contain a full raw HTTP response, meaning:
        Status line (HTTP/1.1 200 OK)
        Headers (Content-Type, Content-Length, etc.)
        Blank line
        Binary body (even garbage bytes are fine)

If you are testing with a big file (like an image or PDF),
the body after headers can be huge â€” that's totally fine.

Key point: it must be ready to write directly to send() on the socket without building anything more.
